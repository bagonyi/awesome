List of awesome tools / books / articles that I find useful for (self) development.

## Tools

#### LNAV - The Logfile Navigator (https://github.com/tstack/lnav)

The log file navigator, lnav, is an enhanced log file viewer that takes advantage of any semantic information that can be gleaned from the files being viewed, such as timestamps and log levels. Using this extra semantic information, lnav can do things like interleaving messages from different files, generate histograms of messages over time, and providing hotkeys for navigating through the file. It is hoped that these features will allow the user to quickly and efficiently zero in on problems.

#### sshrc (https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc)

Bring your .bashrc, .vimrc, etc. with you when you ssh. sshrc works just like ssh, but it also sources the ~/.sshrc on your local computer after logging in remotely.

#### Unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison)

Unison is a file-synchronization tool for OSX, Unix, and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

#### MailCatcher (http://mailcatcher.me)

MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.

#### httpie (https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie)

CLI HTTP client; user-friendly cURL replacement featuring intuitive UI, JSON support, syntax highlighting, wget-like downloads, extensions, etc.

## Articles

## Misc

#### Anki (http://ankisrs.net)

Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

#### HARD with STYLE (https://soundcloud.com/hardwithstyle)

A home to lovers of the harder styles in dance music, and a platform for new talents to shine. Based on the ever so popular monthly Podcast, HARD with STYLE has become more than a record label â€“ a movement in its own right.
